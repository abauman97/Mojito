## Mojito Features
Mojito is just Starlette with some sugar on top. Some of the core features are:

* Message flashing
* Session management
* Global object g (similar to that in Flask)
* Decorator based route and parameter declaration
* Form and data validation based on Pydantic
* Basic security and authentication based on sessions

## Starlette Features
`Mojito` is a sub-class of `Starlette` so any and all the functionality of Starlette is available from within Mojito.
